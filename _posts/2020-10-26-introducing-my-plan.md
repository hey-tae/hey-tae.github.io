### How did I get here? 

I currently work in customer service, of course, I hate it. I have been doing it for the last 10 years because it is easy and doesn't require really any special skills. It was fine when I was trying to figure out what I wanted to do for a career. And I tried and failed at many things. Settled at nursing, then realized I was horrible at science. Moved on to teaching, realized I don't care much for kids. So I decided to just coast until something just happened for me. Not expecting that thing would be becomming a parent. I came to the conclusion that I couldn't coast anymore. (I still did for a bit, but it was easier to blame that on being a new mom) Fast forward 3 years and a global Pandemic later and I found myself in quarantine, layed-off from my customer service job at a company I wanted to be at forever. And I had to quickly get back to the drawing board because no companies were hiring and the unemployment well was going to start drying up soon. I was spending lots of time on youtube looking up career changes and came across a video from a woman that had moved from real estate to software development. I loved everything about the video. The woman was in her mid 20's, black, and feeling lethargic about what her day to day had become. So I took notes on her journey. My first stop was CodeAcademy.com. They were giving away free 90 day memberships for those affected by the pandemic. So I signed up and started taking as much information as I could. I am a person with a million ideas for apps, and things I think would make the world a better place, so I don't knwo why it took me so long to get to this aha moment. But it felt right as soon as I started. Every time I refreshed my browser and saw something I had created I felt the biggest sense of pride. The feeling I imagine people that love their jobs feel on a daily basis. I am determined to learn. To start building and keep building. To turn my ideas into something tangible.
