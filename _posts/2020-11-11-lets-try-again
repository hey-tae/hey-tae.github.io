### fell, picking myself back up 

 This page will now just be a work in progress. I have to figure out a few thing on how I want this to progress  
 test - trying to see whats going on with my repo 
 trying to figure out why the repl caused the first commit to not take 

 #### idea for site 
 since i already have the layout and I am trying to decide if I want to keep using this layout. I think as far as my portfolio I want to build that myself and I want to make my resume on figma - maybe i want to include some design exploration. 
 I think it could be a good idea to put my practice landing pages 

 look up resumes on figma to get an idea 

 also need to look up some sample portolio designs and start thinking about what the build would require
