title: The First 10 Days 
---

### "Failing to plan, is planning to fail"

#### I didn't used to believe this, until I started failing at literally everything I tried to do simply because the ony plan I had was to get it done. This time I am commited to completing this challenge because I know what putting in the work yields. It is daunting for me to think of 100 days all at once, so I figured it would be better for me to break it down into 10 day sections.  

|          Day 1          	|        Day 2        	|        Day 3        	|        Day 4        	|                      Day 5                      	|                 Day 6                	|                Day 7                	|                Day 8                	|                 Day 9                	|                Day 10               	|
