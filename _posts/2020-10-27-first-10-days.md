### "Failing to plan, is planning to fail" - someone really smart

 I didn't used to believe this, until I started failing at literally everything I tried to do simply because the ony plan I had was to get it done. This time I am commited to completing this challenge because I know what putting in the work yields. It is daunting for me to think of 100 days all at once, so I figured it would be better for me to break it down into 10 day sections.  

|          Day 1          	|        Day 2        	|        Day 3        	|        Day 4        	|                      Day 5                      	|                 Day 6                	|                Day 7                	|                Day 8                	|                 Day 9                	|                Day 10               	|

 While I think I have a pretty good handling on HTML. CSS gives me nightmares frequently. Even seeing the word Flexbox has me feeling just like little Ralph.

 Grid & Flexbox are necessary to have in my Front End toolbox so I can't move on until I feel proficient in buildiung basic webpages. I want to spend the first half of these 10 days just learning more about these languages and then the latter half as well as some of the next 10 days, just building web pages. That way when it's time to move onto JavaScript (ðŸ‘€) I have some projects to practice on before moving on to develop my own portfolio. I'll be using the following resources to get through these first 10 days:
 <br>
 **Wes Bos CSS Grid - 4 Hour class to understand Grid [CSS GRID](https://cssgrid.io/)**
<br>
**Wes Bos FlexBox - Videos and Code alongs for practicing Flexbox [Flexbox](https://flexbox.io/)**
<br>
**The champion of free resouces [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org)**
<br>
**[Quizlet](https://quizlet.com) To help me remember syntax**
<br>
The goal here is to not put too much pressure on myself, because I get overwhelmed easily. But have enough structure so that I don't get lost and just quit before I give myself a fighting chance.
